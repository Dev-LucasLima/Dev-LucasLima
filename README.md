### 💻 Personal Projects

To enhance my skills, I decided to start working on a personal project to develop a complete application, which I will divide into different subprojects. Although I am more passionate about Back-end development, I want to gain some (challenging) experience in creating a complete Front-end with Angular and/or other technologies.

The reason? To have the opportunity to experiment with both areas and create small example projects for reference and to help future new programmers (after all, I also teach at a technical IT school 😅).

I started by creating the Back-end, focusing on messaging usage and demonstrating a Microservices example, so feel free to take a look.
